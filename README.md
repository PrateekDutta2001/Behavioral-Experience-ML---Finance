# Customer Behavioral Analysis using Machine Learning Fased Approach on Financial App for Subscription model

In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial technology, innovation is key to enhancing customer experiences and driving growth. Various mobile app has recently hit the market, offering a comprehensive solution for managing finances—from bank loans to savings—all in one place. These app comes in two versions: free and premium (Personal Capital, Acrons, YNAB, Gemini, Cash App, Paypal & many more). While the free version includes basic features, the premium version unlocks advanced capabilities for a small fee.

The computational data-driven approach leverages Machine Learning to predict which users are likely to purchase the premium version. Here’s how it works:

1. Data Collection: Monitoring user interactions with premium features during the free trial period. [Data collected from open source finance repository which is 70% accurate to the reality]

2. Machine Learning Model: Developed a sophisticated ML model to analyze the data and achieve an impressive accuracy of 78.9% in predicting customer behavior. The efficient model has been further saved in specific file structure (such as pickle & joblib).

3. Targeted Marketing: The model identifies users who are interested in the premium features but might be hesitant due to cost. This enables the app to offer targeted promotions to these users, maximizing marketing efficiency and boosting conversions.

The result? A win-win scenario where customers receive tailored offers that meet their needs, and the app maximizes revenue while minimizing advertisement costs.

This innovative approach highlights the power of machine learning in understanding customer behavior and creating personalized marketing strategies. By focusing on users who need a little extra incentive, this strategy ensures resources are used efficiently and effectively, leading to higher customer satisfaction and business growth.
